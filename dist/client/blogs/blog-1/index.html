        <p class="blogP">To master Javascript before the age of thirty is a pretty easy goal to set for.Until I realized that it is just an overall unrealistic gaol to have in mind.In the post I do not want to tell you ways in which you can "Learn to Master Javascript in less the ten years" because that sets up an very bad reputation in the coding space that task can be done and completed before a given time frame.This is a rather simple blog about how the mindset of "Mastery before a given time" can lead to self destruction and more imposter syndrome.Granted this is not a tutorial on how to get over imposter syndrome as I already have a way for you to get over that in another blog.</p>
<h2 class="blogH2"> Goodbye Hello World</h2>
<p>When I first started out my coding journey I had one goal in mind.To become a self taught learner or web design and apply its mysteries to make awesome web pages.And then Wordpress took the world along with single page applications which immediately changed that first goal that I had."The real goal is for me to master Javascript before I'm thirty,that way I will have an expertise on one of the hardest languages to grasp and I will be hirable".Those words still bring me back to my first Hello World post when I first started web design at 22 years old.And to this day I have NO IDEA WHY WOULD I SAY SUCH A THING.Understanding now that most things in life don't have a "Mastery" just a true understanding of the process it takes to reach final results.But I was eager and determined to change my career into something that I can see myself as when I look in the mirror.With that I began to study Javascript as much as I can fully understand.Carrying a book with me to work while taking the bus,</p>
( put a link here for both books)
<p>switching from the book to my phone to look at a youtube that I downloaded just to keep my perspective of concepts fresh.Yet overall one thing was still unclear in my head,how the hell do I ACTUALLY use Javascript? Granted the concept of objects are pretty straight forward once you force yourself to remember real world objects.Functions are easy to see and are to ways to write code without repeating yourself.And notably every loop is basically the same with it's own drawbacks to watch out for.Yet for some reason the idea of how to put my own code together isn't something that my brain was capable of understanding.Considering that every time I look at someone else code it would just be a huge wall of text with words that look familiar but have no understanding.I actually started to compare it to learning another human speaking langauge like Japanese,however I'm not sure which one is harder to learn(Find a link that demonstrates this topic)</p>
<p>If the phrase” I know how to read Javascript ,but I don’t know how to write it” was on a shirt it would sell easy(No more then $6 though, $20  for shirts are outrageous).It would expose you as a junior developer by todays standards but non-the less everyone has been in this state of mind before.I was capable of seeing the potential of what my studying could become in the future but to me there was just one problem that I had in my head towards Javascript.</p>
<h2 class="blogH2">Javascript is the ugliest language to look at</h2>
<p>Granted I didn’t know a single other langauge but at the time seeing a JS files that have the same mark up to interect with the DOM was just ugly to me for some reason.Every tutorial showed a huge cascading list of “GetElementByID,CLass,Query over and over with variable names and parameters that have terrible names that don’t describe what they do or contain(No offense Foo Bar).In my head it reminded me of bulk emails,I understood that there is an invisible layer underneath my html code that allows me to interact with the elements on the page via the browser,but did I really have to have the same repeatable lines of code to do the same task? If thats the case then I should try to memorize these lines of code,even better I should keep a notepad file full of code that I use so I don’t have to copy and paste.(Yet another quote for a shirt idea).This eventually led to me having a file with a bunch of lines of code that I still didn’t fully understand.Again there is a DOM but what the heck causes these undefined errors when ever I try to write my code like someone else.ANd why am I writing a for loop when I’m not sure what it is used FOR? Every example that I see uses a random set of numbers and values that never can be used on a big project.Looking back I realize that my understanding of data and how it can change over time was the problem here.But let’s face it no one wants to just do a bunch of math if you have a calculators on your cell phone.I wanted to make interactive websites that look cool and had cool transitions and functionality.Luckily for me I was in the booming era of a new genereation of web sites.Web applications (I still call them hybrid websites) were the new thing that people were after and mobile devices where considered the primary thing to develop for when making a website.Yet putting these elements on a page small while keeping the mobile design sleek was still a hard task even for big teams.</p>
<h2 class="blogH2">And then came Jquery...</h2>
<p>(Introduce the guy who made Jquery)
My literal experience from observing this person present this idea was that this guy was a rockstar on the developer world.People would go crazy when he hit the stage simply because of the way he made bundling functions easier and readable while making what was essentially componets to structure a web application easy for begginners like me.Darn right he was a rockstar,he was saving everyone time from dealing with messy code(at least in my opinion).This meant that I could biuld the things I needed to make a site function like a mobile app and in the end it worked.Along with applying my CSS knowledge over time and using frameworks like Foundation.I avoided bootstrap to try and make myself stand out and be a rebel and I also hated the amount of classes that do describe their styling but cluttered the html tag with a bunch of classes(wait…tailwind is that you ??).I eventually learned boostrap later but at the time anything new was consider worth a shot back then.All was going according to plan for me in my bright future as a web developer.My ability to understand events in the browser where becoming unmatched and my ability to mimick other stylesand layouts were becoming un matched.And I could see myself putting a portfolio together.But i still don’t know Javascript…</p>
<p>At this time I’m still in my early 20’s  and still not able to grasp how to write Javascript for myself.Code academy works but I was stuck in literal tutorial hell.Again “I understand what this loop does but what am I to use it for in real life?“,was the question that I always had.At this point desperation kicks in and I start trying harder to understand Javascript but doing it desperataly.Jquery was all right but I knew that I had to be good at vanilla JS in order to  how to constructs things while understaning why the code works or breaks at certain points.SO i did what any smart person would do,JUMP TO ANOTHER FRAMEWORK.One that everyone promises will help understand Javascript and its core ,Angular JS.OH,and angular is being paired together wioth another superset langauge called typescript which is the new standard for how to wright code and its based and what is an apparently a new version of Javascript  syntax called ECMA script 6.Great, more learning…</p>
<p>Little did I know this was the thing that was going to demotivate me over time as I mistakingly thought angular was a way to learn JS but instead it was more for things like routing,and having information load properly and of course their big staple MVC(Not Marvel VS Capcom but just as hard to learn).Module View Controller was the one thing that I took away from all of the painfull self teachings that I did.In fact its how I understand what React and all the other frameworks try to perform as well.Yet this was a horrible way to teach myself and I can even say Angulars transition between versions in their early stage did in fact lead to more doubt in my head about being a developer.Again,“Do I have to remember the stuff from the old version and this version and what ever new ground breaking version they come up with next”.The thought of having to do so is literally stopping my ability to simply learn what vanilla JS concepts I need to learn.PLus I still don’t know how to make those cool Parallax scrolling effects on the fly without having to look at a tutorial! At this point a knew Javascript would not be for me and perhaps their will be a language in the future that is much easier to grasp? Or maybe I don’t need to learn any other language at all ?This word press thing is starting to take over anyway right ?</p>

<p>I can’t believe anyone would ever spend so much time developing widgets and date features when thier are ways for use to share features and our Notepade docs of code with other people around the world.Why do that when every web server that you apply a domain to has an easy press option to have your site become a word press site in a few clicks.Then I can manage my site with a cool user interface as well as my customers( that I don’t have) can update their site without having to bother me in the middle of the night like I’ve read in some blog post.Why would anyone ever want to go back to the old days of developing a static HTML page and spend days figuring out the best structure for good SEO.Everything that is ever need will be in the form of a plugin.There is even a plugin to write my own CSS just in case I don’t like some of the default styling.Why would I change this?And then one day I hit a wall again,the paywall.Most themes on wordpress are usually paid for and have great widgets and themes pre-built,the free ones need a bit more custom styling and require some work arounds in order to get a random plugin to work that may not be compatible with it.Oh,and the ones that do are paid plugins as well.I remember wanting to just have a simple slider and thinking to myself”Maybe I can find a way to insert a slider via a div tag and just find a vanilla js slider script online?Which reminded me again  that I still don’t know Javascript.But who cares as  long as I know how to throw myself at a problem and find a way to solve it,nothing else matters.At this point I relize that most of my time is pent troubleshooting problem rather then styling things on the fly(thank goodness I didn’t have to do IE).My ability to adapt and find new ways to create a site is what matters,if I can focus on making Wordpress site sthat look goof without spending any money to biuld would be key to landing more job positions.Or at least so I thought,until I ran into another wall.There is a way to structure a Wordpress theme using a WYSIWYG editor similiar to Wix.com sites.Now all that is left to do is construct my CSS file to personally style the things I need.Yet for some reason this element that I wan’t to target is not responding and some things actaully look odd on page loading.Turns out there are custom Javascript functions in the themes that have some default styling that can’t be overwitten without editing the script itself.Which reminds me, I still don’t know Javascript…</p>
<p>“Maybe learning PHP would be beneficial here since PHP is back on the scene with wordpress being on the rise regardless of that MYSQL injection security flaw I read about ,and I am looking for an easier language for me to grasp,at the time I heard Python was scary hard for beginners of my level still.”
NON OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED in fact I remember making a blog post about the new Gutenberg Editor.And basically trying out Facebook Ads to promote my personal site.I would continueasly try to make custom sites based on free templates and widgets to make landing pages and simple static websites that didn’t require more then an email form using mailChimp. Also learning shopify intergation was a bit tedious since I wasn’t sure about how to handle card information in the best way without relying on plugins to be updated almost every two weeks for security.”It would be great if I could do this on my own,rather then copy pasting other code and giving out my personal email to a newsletter that I will never read to support the dev who made it.Why can’t I go back to making static sites that I can control?I haven’t built a site from scratch in months.If my porfolio isn’t based on code that I have written,am I really a developer?” (I can try to fit that on a shirt I promise).THIS was the point in which my dev journey came to an end and trying to freelance without the ability to be confident in what I’m making just went out the window and into the garbage collection for the next 5-7 years.</p>
