<h2 class="blogH2">You're not an entrepenuar </h2>

Look,I get it we all want to make extra money or have a side hustle.But Your need to advertise computer graphics in someone else twitch channel without first becoming a community member is getting obnoxious.
 The best sellers in the world know how to make a product enticing to someone even if they don't need the item. I'm not saying you should go full on Wolf Of Wall Street and learn the art of pursuision,
 but it would be more beneficial to you in the long run to actually understand how to advertise yourself.
  Your technique of communication is poor and at best will only get the attention of someone under the age of 10 who is extremely nieve to the world.
   You are unprofessional in how you talk to streamers and you should spend some time in retail jobs.
</p>

<h2 class="blogH2">You lack the skill </h2>

<p class="blogP">
  Ar you really putting your best efforts into the graphics that you make? are they original designs? Are you an AI image generator user who doesn't know how to properly draw hands? Are they made within the hour ? Or within the day ? Have you mastered contrast and color theory?
   Have you been using your graphic editor for more then 7 years? Do you observe what other artist (who are clearly better then you) have in their designs that stands out? Do you red design blogs and magazines everyday? Is your portfolio full of the SAME designs over and over?
   Can you make anything other then gamer graphics and panels? Can I hire you to be a true designer who has more then 8-10 hours a day to communicate with me part time?
    More importantly has someone ever told you that you should sell graphics or did you just decide so for yourself?
     There are several reason why you are not selling or getting the monetization that you strive for other then the fact that you are extremely desperate for approval of your skills.

  <h2 class="blogH2">My Advice...</h2>

<p class="blogP">
As I have said before are you simply JUST a twitch graphic artist because the world needs things other the you hockey team logo/ You can make memes on social media to display your art style or the type of humor you have whether it be political,gaming,technology,or hey even bigotry if you want.
 I would rather you find yourself and understand what makes you unique and gain a following off of that rather then attention seeking attitude.
  Hoping and dreaming that someone will be foolish enough to give you a single cent for doing basically the low minimum amount of work will not get you anything but more tears in your anime pillow at night.
  </p>
  <p class="blogP">
  Expand yourself to being more then just a graphic designer and sell your PERSONALITY instead. 
  If people like you they will easily ask you to make graphics for them.
  Like I said, post your art on social media sites like Bluesky. 
  Granted,I certainly won't be looking at that horrendous artifact you created in ten minutes, but at least someone will find it interesting that you made an attempt to sell YOURSELF rather then selling your pride and ego.
