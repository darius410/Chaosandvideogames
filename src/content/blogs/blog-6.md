To be clear this is a blog post about Video games that become Movies rather then movies that become video games because I do belive there is a hard difference .I originally was going to make a blog post called 'WHY VIDEO GAME MOVIES WILL NEVER BE GOOD'. But I decided to change the title after having just seen Tetris the movie .A movie that I thought would more than likely be a failure due to previous video game movie titles not doing that well either.  However, the Tetris movie surprised me by keeping my attention throughout the entire movie doing parts that normally would put most people to sleep due to the amount of talking that I predicted would have to go into such a movie. I honestly thought that it would have more of the structural tone of a documentary rather than a fun little movie that tells a story about the struggles that were in place to have Tetris become a purchasable game globally.
Not to say that I didn't have any faith and video games movies, in fact, it's my hope that video game movies continue to be as great as they are. Currently next on my list is actually the super Mario movie regardless of any inconsistencies with the voice of the red hat wearing hero that we are all used to.But because I have already heard of how well the movie is it excites me to write this post in regards to how video game movies are trending to be seen as actual things to look forward to seeing in theaters just like any other marvel movie. But even Marvel movies are capable of flopping in terms of audience reception.

 
The history of video game movie adaptations and their mixed success



It should be obvious that video games with bad adaptations first started in the early days of gaming, probably around the late 80 leading in the early 90's. To be fair the idea of having an item paired with a movie franchis was absolutely amazing.Who didn't rush to get the rare pokemon cards for the first Pokemon movie? If a movie came out it was sure to be followed by sort of product advertising on Food,toys,clothing,etc.Yet for some reason video games were the worst things to pair together with a movie,even though it was the best era in gaming history when the 'console wars' were a thing.
The first movie that started this trend of bad VGM's for me personally was assassins creed. To summarize my feelings about the idea itself,just know the very second I saw the teaser trailer for this movie I thought to myself "I didn't ask for this".I have been a member of the AC fanboy all the way up to the Assassin Creed 3.Letting the non existent faction into my real life by remembering the three rules like my own and even dressing like the characters in some way through high school.Because why not wear a white hood with every outfit to represent my teen angst which was definitely not a phase in my life. Trust me when I tell you that being a big fan of the franchise and feeling absolutely nothing as a piece of media with a (insert budget size here) sized budget hits the box office.It actually made me sad that I knew the movie wasn't going to be a success. How did I know ? Because the Assassins Creed franchise was already suffering with a divisive fan base over whether the new games are better and I doubt a movie starring a popular actor is going to fix that.

 
Are there any good ones out there?


Often times people will bring up games like Resident Evil and Tomb raider when mentioning movies that are successfull. But In my opinion those movies are only succesfull at NOT MAKING THE AUDIENCE UPSET just enough so that the movie isn't poorly reviewed.For example,the resident evil movies that star Mia Jolavich have almost no reference to the original games but they offer name drops and a plot that is familiar to the originals.Not to mention the tone overall doesn't come off as scary because the main character is confident in her abilities to shoot machine guys while running down the side of a skyscraper.Nothing about this movie stood out as resident evil since it didnt involve being stuck in a mansion and solving obscure puzzles the entire time.
There are other movies that I did enjoy that fell into the catagory of 'It wasn't good, but at least they got the character right'.
Agent 47 (2015)
Need For Speed (2014)
Prince Of Persia Sands of time (2010)

How ever all of these games are still consider to be contreversy among fans of the original games. I belive this is simply becuase gameres don't want to see references to things they already know exist but rather see a story that is familiar but with a new twist.BUT even if you do that you may end up having a movie that doesn't stick to the source material and that will be the biggest complaint.If you don't beleive me ask a gamer about thier opinion on the mortal kombat movie and how close to the original game is paired with it.Again,allot of great references to things we know but one change to the story element and it was all over.The main character was an unknown fighter not from any games,and all of the great characters were out of touch with who we fell in love with over the years.This din't do good with the fact that currently the latest Mortal Kombat Game (MK11) is not well received by the current fanbase,even from professional players.Granted poeple will never not buy a mortal kombat game but it still shows how something like a failed movie can have people look at a franchise differently.
