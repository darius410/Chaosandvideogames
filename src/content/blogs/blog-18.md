<h2 class="blogH2">WHAT INSPIRED THIS ARTICLE?</h2>

<p class="blogP">
With the recent failures such  as suicide squad kills the justice league and gotham knights and even Mortal Kombat One it seems possible that WB could be considered on its last legs in terms of its gaming sector. The last remaining hope for them could be Multiverses with it's new release date set for May.
</p>

<h2 class="blogH2">WHY IS MULTIVERSES THE LAST CHANCE?</h2>

<p class="blogP">
Multiverses was canceled during its beta last year in 2023 after being available for less then  a year. In that period there have been several people who enjoy its smash like gameplay and wacky characters mechanics and of course seeing childhood icons like the Iron Giant face of against superman. Now that multiverses will return sometime in May it just begs the question.

"Will Warner Bros focus on Monitization for this game rather then making the game a great and fun experience"
</p>
<p class="blogP">
We already know that it will be a free to play game which of course means it will have micro transactions.I have no problem with games to have some form of marketplace that lets you spend real money.The problem lies in the tactics that are used to pursued people into buying them,or when people believe that the items themselves don't equate to the cost of them. Currently this is the problem with Mortal Kombat 1 as it contains micro transactions that don't benefit the player.
-Paying for fatalities which were always free 
-items costing way to much with no great value
-lack of content for non competitive multiplayer players
</p>

<p class="blogP">With the amount of criticism about Suicide Squad Kills The Justice League it's the obvious that gamers are here for a good stories, not just games.Imagine having God of war as a games as a service title ,when the main focus of the game is about a father and son relationship.
I feel that WB has been on its decline ever since the discovery merger a few years back. I'm not an expert in stocks but as far as the WB games section of their portfolio goes it's possible that Warner Bros may have to stop producing games considering non of them have been a success recently other then the previous Batman Arkham games.

<h2 class="blogH2">YET SOMEHOW WARNER BROS DOESNT GIVE A F#$!</h2>
<p class="blogP">
Seriously if you had a failed product would you resell a different version of that product with the same features that no one likes? Apparently Warner Bros seems to think that this game is only a small failure in terms of profit  but can also pave the way for new titles going forward.This same behavior reminds me of Square Enix still considering NFT's as something gamers want to have.
</p>
<p class="blogP">
Because of this attitude towards live service games it becomes painfully clear that every game going forward will have terrible Monitization practices.Similiar to the problems that I displayed for Mortal Kombat 1, Multiverses could likely suffer if it chooses to simply become a game for skins like overwatch and fortnite.Again,there is nothing wrong with skins,but if the cost of the skin is to high and the marketplace rotates in a way the inspires FOMO to the individual player,then obviously the gaming community will riot.
</p>
<p class="blogP">
Halo Infinite had this issue during its launch.Rather then focusing on game modes and features that let players look a certain way and play a certain way,the main focus was the new battle pass additions and Monitization for items that didn't improve gameplay 
</p>
<h2 class="blogH2">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p class="blogP">
I know I have a tendency so say what is obvious,but I enjoy talking about these things so much that I have to write them down the second I get the topic in my head.With that said Multiverses comes out in May and will have a variety of new features that are sure to improve it's overall presentation as a video game compared to a year ago when it was just announced.
</p>
<p class="blogP">
What is the most you would pay for a skin? Does it depend on the game or how much you play it?There isnt a real study for the patterns of  how much players would spend but we should certainly start to research what is to much in terms of cost and what are people willing to pay for in general.
