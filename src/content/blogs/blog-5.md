Im not a Dr or a researcher when it comes to these things but I often say that the psychology that is used to biuld the video game is often better then playing the game itself.Forgive me for liking the idea of how a games art direction effects player choices and enjoyment in the game.But the topic of how using AI in video games effects the brain is something that I never thought I would have to look deeply into, considering that most games already have an AI implemented in them such as fighting games and even first person shooters of all kinds.
Granted its a hard coded AI that adapts to the players movement and button presses but true AI comes in the form of machine learning concepts and analyzing the players data to make adjustments to gameplay.I would argue that draw distance in video games is a form of AI since the game inside has to consider that players location and decide what elements should be displayed on screen for the sake of having the game run smooth.

But what happens to the player when they realize that the game they are playing is using AI so much that they are unable to challange themselves or connect to the characters emotionally based on the responses sounding to robotic.You would think this stuff doesn't matter but its just as bad as talking to a voice operator over the phone rather then just talking to a human being on the other side that can understand emotional queues.

Here I have gathered a list of ethical and dangerous things to consider regarding the use of AI in video games whether its assisting the player or working against the player. As well as a few reference to articles and research papers that discuss these in further detail because who doesn't love to read(that's why you're here right?).

Impact on player immersion:
Ethical concerns regarding AI programming:
Impact on emotional response:
Dependence on AI
Autonomy and control
Immersion and realism;
Emotional response:
Bias and representation:
Ethical implications:
Psychological impact:
Player experience
Privacy:


These are allot of topics but I'm only going to go through the ones that I know wont make this article a one hour read.

3. Impact on player immersion: The use of AI in video games may impact the player's sense of immersion in the game world. If the AI characters and environments are not realistic or responsive enough, it may break the player's immersion in the game. This can lead to a negative experience and potentially discourage players from playing the game further.

4. Ethical concerns regarding AI programming: The use of AI in video games raises ethical concerns regarding how the AI is programmed and the potential consequences of its actions. For example, if an AI character in a game behaves in a way that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or biases, it can reinforce these negative attitudes in players. Additionally, if the AI is programmed to prioritize certain behaviors over others, it can potentially limit player choice and autonomy within the game world.

5. Impact on emotional response: AI in video games has the potential to impact player emotional response to the game. For example, if AI characters exhibit lifelike emotions and responses to player actions, it can enhance the player's emotional investment in the game. However, if the AI characters behave in a way that is insensitive or offensive to the player, it can lead to a negative emotional response and impact player experience.

6. Dependence on AI: The use of AI in video games can lead to a dependence on the technology. This can potentially limit the creative output of game developers and reduce the overall diversity of game design. Additionally, if AI becomes too integral to the gameplay experience, it can discourage players from engaging in other aspects of the game or seeking out alternative game experiences.

1. Autonomy and control: How does the use of AI in video games impact player autonomy and control? Does it enhance or diminish the player's ability to make decisions and feel in control of their gaming experience?

2. Immersion and realism: To what extent does the use of AI in video games enhance immersion and realism? Does it make the gaming experience feel more authentic and engaging, or can it detract from immersion by introducing artificial or robotic elements?

The potential loss of immersion if players become aware of AI manipulation or cheating
	* 
The risk of overreliance on AI for creating immersive experiences, which can lead to a lack of creativity and diversity in gameplay
	* 
The ethical considerations of using AI to manipulate player emotions for the sake of immersion




3. Emotional response: How does the use of AI in video games impact player emotional response? Does it enhance the emotional engagement of players or can it lead to negative emotional experiences, such as frustration or disappointment?

4. Bias and representation: How does the use of AI in video games impact issues of bias and representation, particularly in relation to gender, race, and other identity categories? Can AI perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases in video game development and gameplay?

5. Ethical implications: What are the ethical implications of using AI in video game development and gameplay, particularly in terms of data privacy, algorithmic accountability, and the potential for harm to players?

6. Psychological impact: How does the use of AI in video games impact player psychology and well-being? Are there potential negative consequences, such as addiction, social isolation, or other mental health issues?

7. Player experience: What are the overall effects of using AI in video games on the player experience? Does it enhance or detract from enjoyment and engagement with video games?
