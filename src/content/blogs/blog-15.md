Often times when a game gets praised, the director of the company usually excepts thanks for the game being tremendously well.But what about the other team members that worked on it? What about those hundreds of developers who crunch away at the things that make the game have it's overall success.Look,I know the director is the top of the pyramid that keeps the team motivated and focused on their work. However almost more then often the developers who are paired in cubicles and and large tables with little arm, room are the ones who never get the credit or recognition that they deserve.</p>

A simple way to put it is like this...when you think of Amazon you think of Jeff Bezos. Not the team of staff that are in call centers,not the people who manage refunds, not the people who work in the Amazon warehouse for ten to twelve hours straight or even the vendors who are selling on the site itself,you only think of the person at the top who has a reputable name for themselves.Again,If someone has done allot of hard work to make a company then by all means,they should be at the top.But let's be honest the only reward that Jeff's staff might get is an office christmas party and some slight pay raises over the next few months if they are not laid off. The same can be said for the game companies that we know of. Usually the director is the one who accepts the award and praise on behalf of the staff. But it would be nice once in awhile to see some of the developers atleast having a nice smile or a reaction to seeing thier hard work pay off</p>

Seeing popular faces like Hideo Kojima being praised for their vision knowing that there are other smart people on his staff that work just as hard.

How can we support developers who have no real say in what the final outcome of the game will be? We have all heard terrible stories about being over worked and having to do "crunch time" in order to get the game ready for it's initial launch date.Supporting video game developers who may not be widely recognized can make a significant impact on their morale and career satisfaction.Just like my other blog post about supporting small streamers we need to also support individual developers who are under the ranks of directors and don't receive any credit.With that here are five ways in which you can reach out and give some support to those staff members WITHOUT buying thier game.Remember, buying the game doesn't directly go into thier pockets and gives them vacation days.Most of the time a budget is set in place and no one is able to get a huge raise or bonus check regardless of how many copies are sold.The 2023 Game Of The Year winner was Elden Ring. Elden Ring sold millions of copies,but who gets all of the money from those copies...Bandai Namco,not From Software.

<h2 class="blogH2">Share Social Media Post</h2>
<p class="blogP">
This One is obvious but the first way to support developers would be through social media platforms.Every game company has a social media presence of some kind and more then likely have more then just a twitter account.
